 # This template gets loaded whenever /search/results is requested, because a
 # route has been set up from Settings > Routes to direct traffic to that URL
 # to this template.
 #
 # The search form in the site's global header is set up to submit search
 # queries to /search/results, with a `q` param in the query string containing
 # teh search term. This template extracts that param's value and passes it
 # to craft.entries' `search` param, and outputs the resulting entries.
